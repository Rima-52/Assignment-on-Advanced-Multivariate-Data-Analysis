## Introduction  

This assignment for the **Advanced Multivariate Analysis** course applies a range of statistical techniques to explore and interpret multivariate datasets. The analysis focuses on uncovering patterns, relationships, and structures that emerge when dealing with multiple variables simultaneously.  

The methods covered in this work include:  
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** – Reducing data dimensionality while retaining maximum variance.  
- **Factor Analysis** – Identifying hidden latent factors that explain observed variable correlations.  
- **Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)** – Examining interrelationships between two sets of variables.  
- **Covariance Matrix Analysis** – Measuring the variance and covariances among variables.  
- **Correspondence Analysis** – Analyzing relationships between categorical variables in contingency tables.  

All analyses were conducted using **statistical software** with appropriate visualization tools to aid interpretation. The repository contains all necessary **data files, scripts, and output results** to ensure reproducibility and transparency.  

This work demonstrates the application of multivariate statistical methods in real-world data analysis, enhancing both interpretability and practical problem-solving skills.
